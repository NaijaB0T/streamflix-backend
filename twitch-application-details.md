Twitch API Client Configuration

Use this pane to manage Twitch API access to your extension.

OAuth Client Name
This is the name of your extension as visible on the API Authorization screen, should you need to generate tokens for Third Party requests. Your Extension name cannot include any form of the words "Extension," "Twitch," or "Glitch". If you are looking to change the name of your extension, as it is displayed on the directory and other locations, you can do so in the Version Details section for a particular extension version.

StreamFlix
40 characters maximum, 25 characters recommended.

Twitch API Client Secret
OAuth Redirect URL
Will receive the result of all client authorizations: either an access token or a failure message. This must exactly match the redirect_uri parameter passed to the authorization endpoint. When testing locally, you can set this to the http://localhost. A maximum of 10 redirect URLs is supported.

https://localhost
Extension Client Configuration

Use this pane to retrieve and rotate your client ID secrets, used to make requests to the Twitch and Extensions API.

Extension Secrets
Each Extension maintains a shared secret that is used to sign tokens that provide the identity of users. Use this authentication method when making extension API calls from your EBS, for endpoints that support it.
